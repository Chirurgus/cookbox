recipe => id, name, description, last_modified, time?, yield?, source?, ingredient_list, instruction*, note*, tag*
time => unit, total_time, preparation_time?, cook_time?
yield => unit, total_yield, serving_size?
ingredient_list => (ingredient_group | ingredient)*
ingredient_group => group_name, ingredient, ingredient*
ingredient => quantity, unit, basic_ingredient, note*
basic_ingredient => description, code? # code could be the usda code for this ingredient
instruction => text_instruction, note*
note => (image | text)

id,recipe_ref,ingredient_id ARE id_type
total_time,preparation_time,cook_time,total_yield,serving_size,quantity ARE numeric
name,description,source,cuisine,tag,unit,group_name,instruction,text ARE character strings
image IS an image

# Notes:
# In a relational database
#   - the * fields are simulated with another table, with a foreign key column (many to one relationship).
#   - the | or fields are simulated with two nullable columns and a check that only one is non null. ,
#   - Recipe groups are created by having a nullable column for the group_id in ingredient, and a list of ingredient_groups in recipe

# Some design decisions:
# I decided to exclude the ability to refer to another recipe to keep every recipe atomic.
# In stead for convineiance, clients should include the ability to add ingredients/instructions from another recipe,
